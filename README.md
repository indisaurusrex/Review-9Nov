# Review 9 November 2020

Scanning through maths paper looking for sums
extraccts as strings
evaluate as sum
original + result

string calculator

input = string
output = combination of that string and the value of the string
example:
"1.5 * -1" => ["1.5 * -1", -1.5]
basic arithmetic + - * /
longer sums in future, for now just simple
one operator for now
computer output is ok, no rounding needed.
if not string: input must be a valid string
ArgumentError "Input must be a string"
ZeroDivisionError "divided by zero"
2 operators or anything for invalid string:
MathError "Input must be a valid mathematical string"
"1 + * 0.1"
function or class only for now. 
empty string = 0
single number in string = single number

input output: 

"" => ["", 0]
"1" => ["1", 1]
"1.5" => 1.5
"1 + 1" => 2
"1 - 1" => 0
"2 * 3" => 6
"10 / 2" => 5
